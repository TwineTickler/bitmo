HOW TO (Developers):

To make changes to the DB:

    Add this code to db.py on line 41 (after close connection function):
    And of course you can change your SQL in this block.

def alter_db(conn):
    c = conn.cursor()
    try:
        c.execute("""

        ALTER TABLE quote
        ADD cmc_rank INTEGER
        
        """)
        close_db_connection(conn)
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)

Then add this code to run.py on line 15 after the import statements:

import db
conn = db.open_db_connection()
db.alter_db(conn)
exit()

Select your environment (aka, database name), and run once. Then revert changes.

TODO:

1. Create a logging script - DONE

2. determine a method of saving data to a database from python. - DONE
    a. It seems that we have a SQLite instance to use for this. 
    b. https://towardsdatascience.com/yes-python-has-a-built-in-database-heres-how-to-use-it-b3c033f172d3

3. verify connectivity to the coin market cap API - DONE

4. Determine what data is available to us in the endpoints
v1/cryptocurrency/Listings/Latest:
    Name: Bitcoin
    symbol: BTC 
    num_market_pairs: 10209
    date_added: 2010-07-13
    cmc_rank: 1
    last_updated: 2023-05-18T04:27:00.000Z
    infinite_supply: False
    quote
        USD
            price: 27321.xxxxxxxx
            volume_24h: xxxxxx.xxxxxx
            volume_change_24h: 23.23
            'percent_change_1h': -0.15257566, 
            'percent_change_24h': 0.89425865, 
            'percent_change_7d': -0.39709286, 
            'percent_change_30d': -7.3645651, 
            'percent_change_60d': 0.44944957, 
            'percent_change_90d': 14.77258088,
            'market_cap': 529401291138.8631,
            last_updated: '2023-05-18T04:27:00.000Z'
    platform
        ID
        name
        symbol
        slug
        token_address

v2/cryptocurrency/Quotes/Latest:

data on the currency, as well as quote data. (similar to Listings/Latest)

5. Determine what data we could like to use for caluculation:
    price
    percent_change_24h (trading price)
    percent_change_7d  (trading price)
    percent_change_7d  (trading price)
    volume_change_24h
    cmc_rank ------------
    market_cap ---------- These two can both be used for the same thing. CMC rank is just a rank based off market cap
    symbol 
    num_market_pairs     

Listings/Latest -> used to get ALL currencies
Quotes/Latest -> used to get price for a particular currency

* Another idea is that we could also find newly listed Crypto's based off of date_added.

                timestamp NUMERIC,

                last_updated_cmc NUMERIC <--- timestamp from cmc
            )

6. Determine algorythm we will use to find suitable currencies.

    a. first lets get ALL of the currencies and put them in a database.
        run in sandbox first to make sure we can get them all, then production to see how many there are (how expensive this will be to run daily)


7. Successfully retrieve that data from sandbox

8. Create a database that can store this data

9. Write the data to the database 


Troubleshooting:

# the following is only used for troubleshooting:
# print(data['status'])
# print(data['data'])
# print('number of currencies is: ' + str(len(data['data'])) + '\n')
# print(str(data['data'][0]) + '\n')
# print(str(data['data'][1]) + '\n')
# print(str(data['data'][2]) + '\n')
# print(str(data['data'][3]) + '\n')
# print(str(data['data'][4]) + '\n')
# print(str(data['data'][5]))

10. test production to see 
    a. that everything saves correctly. - DONE
    b. to see how expensive it is (cmc credits) to download all the listings, once a day.
        - DONE: we can afford to get everything once per day.

11. create some kind of infinite (not really infinite) loop that only runs the downloads once a day.
    - In progress

12. Add total_count to response_status in DB. <-- done.

ALTER TABLE response_status
ADD total_count INTEGER 

13. Add cmc_rank AND num_market_pairs from currency table to the quotes table as well. <-- Done!

14. Setup to run once a day.

How to make this work:
- Run at 8:00 PM Central every day. (nothing much going on)
- Program run constently:
    - checks in every hour
    - then begins count down to run time.
    - every hour verifies when the latest entries were made to the database and confirms:
        - 8:00 PM will be between 23 and 25 hours since last insert.
            - If it has been LONGER than 25 hours, run immediately.
            - If less: run in 23 hours SINCE last run.

from Timer (initial logic):

'''
When to run an API call?

based off 3 things:
    Target Time - currently 9:00 PM
    Current Time
    Time Since Last Call

If hour is:

    less than 24:
        If current hour is 9:00 PM -> then at 9:00 PM
        If current hour is NOT 9:00 PM -> then at hour 23

        Ex:

            Time Since: 23 hours
                Current Time: 4:00 PM

                    next run: +2: 9:00 PM + 24 hours

                    last run: 9:00 PM
                    next run: 9:00 PM + 24 hours

    equal to or greater than 24:
        Run now

15. once the downloads are done. create functions to begin looking at trends.
